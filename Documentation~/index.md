## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Rewired Glyphs?

Rewired Glyphs is a Unity package designed as an expansion for [Guavaman's Rewired](https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/) input system that implements a convenient API for showing sprites and descriptions for player actions. As such, Rewired is *required* for this package to function and is *not* included in this package. You must purchase [Rewired at the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Rewired and Guavaman are *not* associated with this package nor its development.
> This package is developed independently and therefore you should not ask for support with this package anywhere other than this package's [issue](https://github.com/Orange-Panda/Rewired-Glyphs/issues) and [discussion](https://github.com/Orange-Panda/Rewired-Glyphs/discussions) pages.
